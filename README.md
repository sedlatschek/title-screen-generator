# Title Screen Generator

![Logo](public/android-chrome-192x192.png)

I create a lot of hiking videos. Each of them has a short title screen in which waypoints and some statistics about the trip are shown. Each title screen costs me around 5 minutes to make, thats why I want to automate the process. The goal is to achieve pixel perfect line lenghts and spacing.

I use [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com) aswell as a HTML5 canvas to draw the title screen. There is a lot of pixel measuring going on, which makes the tool pretty heavy to run.
